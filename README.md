# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description
This webpage contains a random password generator. You can create a password that is 8-128 characters that can include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

To get started you click on the red generate password button, and a prompt will pop up asking how many characters you would like your password to be. (The default number is 8 but if you enter a number less than 8 or greater than 128, an alert will let you know that it must be 8-128 characters. If you enter letters, an alert will let you know that it is not a number.) 

After you chose how many characters you want in your password it will prompt you if you want any lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and/ or special characters. If you click OK, you are saying that you want that character in your password and if you click cancel, that means you do not want it in your password. Once you finish the prompts an autogenerated random password will appear in the box. If you do not choose any characters then an alert will let you know that you need to choose at least one lowercase, uppercase, numerical, or symbol to proceed.
